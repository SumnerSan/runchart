Description: A number of R packages exist to automate statistical process 
    control charts. For example: qicharts, qcc, ggQC. This package is different 
    because it focuses solely on run charts and provides the ability to 
    automatically rephase baselines. The package exports a single easy to use 
    function: runchart().
