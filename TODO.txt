remove reliance on tidyverse (not enough benefit to justify)
Adjust first_index to handle all-NA vectors better (i.e. without producing a warning)
test_sus - add more tests for non-useful observations
rebase() - add more tests for new variable "end"
tidy up code
  lots of commented code
  use this in other functions: if (sum(val %notin% c(NA, base)) < trigger)
  tidy up function/variable names

tweak tickers so they know where to start themselves
prefix function names with verbs
write package vignette



#Adjust first_chunk to act more common-sense with vectors smaller than 8
#Rename utility functions to something more meaningful
#Write tests for runchart()
