Adjust first_index to handle all-NA vectors better (i.e. without producing a warning)
test_sus - add more tests for non-useful observations
rebase() - add more tests for new variable "end"
tweak tickers so they know where to start themselves
tidy up code - lots of commented code
use this in other functions: if (sum(val %notin% c(NA, base)) < trigger)
tidy up function/variable names


#Adjust first_chunk to act more common-sense with vectors smaller than 8
#Rename utility functions to something more meaningful
